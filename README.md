# RAG_based_business-guidance_and_nic-code_finder-

The NIC code, or National Industrial Classification code, is a system developed by the Indian government to classify economic activities. It's a numerical classification scheme used to categorize businesses based on their primary activity, like manufacturing, services, or trading . 

this project is inspired by iit gandhingar's hack for future hackathon's problem statement regarding the semantic search of NIC code , the traditional method was using a keyword based serach algorithm for search of nic code for the business but here we use the sematic approach using RAG , 
additionaly we have added context of business regstration in india so that our chatbot not only give nic code but also guidance regarding business setup.
